jQuery Countdown Timer
====================================

Forked from https://github.com/jtallant/countdown-timer

Wanted:

1. an obnoxiously big timer for display
2. that annoyingly and visually made it clear when time was up (turn the background red after time goes negative)
3. continued to count after the timer had hit zero
4. had buttons for setting the timer that would be easy to operate from a touch device

Purpose: For EO forum meeting time keeping.
